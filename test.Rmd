##### **Abstract**

##### **Background**
Covid-19 is a viral infection caused by the novel virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2). Incubation period of Covid-19 is 2-14 days, which is the time a person shows symptoms after being exposed to the virus. The main symptoms are fever, cough, runny nose, headache, fatigue and muscle aches. \n
The virus was first recorded in China in Fall 2019, however, around February 2020 it started rapidly spreading across the world. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 to be a global pandemic. One of the most tragic events of Covid-19 was the first wave of the virus in Italy, where around 44,000 deaths and 250,000 infections were recorded in just 3 months, from March to May 2020. Overwhelmed hospitals, shortage of medical supplies, hospital beds, icu units and medical staff, were a great challenge during the first wave of the virus. However, the fear of these factors is rising as the second wave of the pandemic is currently happening in the world. The virus has caused over 3 million deaths and has spread across 188 countries to date. \n
Governments all over the world have instructed people who tested positive for Covid-19 to quarantine for 14 days if they have mild symptoms or to visit the nearest hospital if they experience difficulty breathing, cyanosis or chest pain. People are considered at high risk of developing more serious symptoms or death if they have pre-existing medical conditions such as, but not limited to, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease, obesity, smoking, immunocompromised, heart conditions, type two diabetes and cancer. Older age population is also at higher risk, as they are more likely to have a pre-existing medical condition and lower immunity. \n
As Covid-19 is still a threat to public health worldwide and the second wave of the virus is now growing globally, information is needed by medical professionals and people tested positive with Covid-19 when making decisions on whether hospitalization is needed. The use of machine learning is growing in the fight against Covid-19. \n
A death prediction app can assist medical professionals to make decisions on which patients are at high risk and require hospitalization. In addition, the app can also assist people infected with Covid-19 in deciding whether to self-quarantine or go to a hospital. We expect that our application, when used in conjunction with expert medical advice, will help guide resource allocation during the second wave. 

##### **Objective**

The objective of this project is to create a supervised machine learning model that predicts probability of death due to Covid-19 based on age and pre-existing medical conditions. This app could be used by medical professionals to guide resource allocation for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Having an app that predicts death probability can help hospitals decide which patients need hospitalization. In addition, the app can also be used by people who test positive with covid-19 as a guide to decide whether they should visit the hospital. Having this app can reduce unnecessary surges to the hospital of people who are at low risk. The app is simple to use and would be easily accessible by anyone. \n
Disclaimer: This application should only be used as a guide and is not a replacement for expert advice or government recommendations.

#### **Data Analysis**
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tanmoyx/covid19-patient-precondition-dataset) was made publicly available from the Mexican government. It has over 560,000 anonymous records of patients who attended a hospital from March â€“ July 2020 regarding Covid-19. Over 200,000 records were confirmed positive for Covid-19.
